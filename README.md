## Description
The client wanted to understand the impacts of updates and changes to the project schedule and monitor these updates when they happen.
<br>
The solution provides a general overview of the activities, milestones and links for the project. Then goes into detail regarding the variance between planned and actual start / end dates for activities and milestones. Finally, it demonstrates a feature we would want to add had the data not be anonymised where we highlight key ‘high risk’ or ‘mission critical’ activities such as cranage and finds the average delay of any of these activities across multiple projects, which can then be used to derive an average cost for this risk.
Example 1:
<pre>
>>> 2+3
5
</pre>

Example 2:
```python
x = 1
y = 3
print(x + y)
```
