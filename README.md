Project Hack 11
## Problem Statement
The client wanted to understand the impact of project schedule updates and monitor these updates when they happen. For the challenge, we were provided with multiple project update files showing activities, milestones, and links between activities. 
<br>
## Our Solution
The solution provides a general overview of the activities, milestones and links for the project. Then goes into detail regarding the variance between planned and actual start / end dates for activities and milestones. Finally, it demonstrates a feature we would want to add had the data not be anonymised where we highlight key ‘high risk’ or ‘mission critical’ activities such as cranage and finds the average delay of any of these activities across multiple projects, which can then be used to derive an average cost for this risk.
Example 1:
<pre>
>>> 2+3
5
</pre>

Example 2:
```python
x = 1
y = 3
print(x + y)
```
