## Project Description
This challenge was set by Nplan, a UK-based software company which utilises machine learning and AI analytics to forecast outcomes of construction projects and mitigate risk.
## Problem Statement
The client wanted to understand the impact of project schedule updates and monitor these updates when they happen.
<br>
## Solution
Our solution provides a general overview of the activities, milestones and links for the project. Then goes into detail regarding the variance between planned and actual start / end dates for activities and milestones. Finally, it demonstrates a feature we would want to add had the data not be anonymised where we highlight key ‘high risk’ or ‘mission critical’ activities such as cranage and finds the average delay of any of these activities across multiple projects, which can then be used to derive an average cost for this risk.


## Future Development

Example 1:
<pre>
>>> 2+3
5
</pre>

Example 2:
```python
x = 1
y = 3
print(x + y)
```
